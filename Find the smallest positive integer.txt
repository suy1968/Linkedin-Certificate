Question:- Find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array

Problem Statement:-

Given an array of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as the sum of elements of any subset of a given set. 
The expected time complexity is O(nlogn).

Input:  arr[] = {1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 15};
Output: 2

Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
Output: 5

Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 4};
Output: 10

Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40};
Output: 4

Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
Output: 22





Solution:-
Using a simple loop, we can solve this problem in O(N log N) time. Let the input array be arr[0..n-1]. We first sort the array in non-decreasing order. 
Let the smallest element that cannot be represented by elements at indexes from 0 to (i-1) be ‘res’.  We initialize ‘res’ as 1 (smallest possible answer) and 
traverse the given array from i=0.  There are the following two possibilities when we consider element at index i:

1) We decide that ‘res’ is the final result: If arr[i] is greater than ‘res’, then we found the gap which is ‘res’ because the elements after arr[i] are also going to be greater 
than ‘res’.

2)The value of ‘res’ is incremented after considering arr[i]: If arr[i] is not greater than ‘res’, the value of ‘res’ is incremented by arr[i] so ‘res’ = ‘res’+arr[i] (why? If elements from 0 to (i-1) can 
represent 1 to ‘res-1’, then elements from 0 to i can represent from 1 to ‘res + arr[i] – 1’ by adding arr[i] to all subsets that represent 1 to ‘res-1’ which we have already determined to be represented)
Following is the implementation of the above idea. 


Code:- 

def findSmallest(arr, n):
 
    res = 1 #Initialize result
 
    # Traverse the array and increment
    # 'res' if arr[i] is smaller than
    # or equal to 'res'.
    for i in range (0, n ):
        if arr[i] <= res:
            res = res + arr[i]
        else:
            break
    return res
 
 
# Driver program to test above function
arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 5]
n1 = len(arr1)
print(findSmallest(arr1, n1))
 
arr2= [1, 2, 6, 10, 11, 15]
n2 = len(arr2)
print(findSmallest(arr2, n2))
 
arr3= [1, 1, 1, 1]
n3 = len(arr3)
print(findSmallest(arr3, n3))
 
arr4 = [1, 1, 3, 4]
n4 = len(arr4)
print(findSmallest(arr4, n4))
